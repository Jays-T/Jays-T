## ðŸ’¬ Hi there, my name is John Traas but most people call me Jays
ðŸ’¬ I have a great affinity for all things UI/UX and design related.
The logic of back-end fascinates me. I love exploring new technologies and learning. I am open to anything and am currently job searching.


I've been lucky enough to have traveled a large portion of the world while pursuing my passion for Music and Design in Tech. 

If you want to get in touch you can:


- ðŸ‘¯ Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-jacob-hald-traas-25603325/) - 
- ðŸ”­ I recently mentored two teams for the Code Institute Hackathon [Code Institute St Patricks Day Hackathon](https://hackathon.codeinstitute.net/). I am working on [My Portfolio](https://jays-t.github.io/resume) which will be my personal site and I took part in Hacktober Fest contributing four successful PR's to [Code Institute Hackathon App](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Community/ci-hackathon-app) for experience, and the fun of collaborating with fellow coders.
- ðŸŒ± At the moment I am learning : [React](https://reactjs.org/) and diving deeper into [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

- :dizzy_face: I'm often found being continuously bamboozled by: JavaScript (it's all part of the fun though! ðŸ˜„ )
- :musical_note: I'm also a musician/songwriter/producer with [Contrast Parity](https://soundcloud.com/contrastparity) and guitarist with [Darwiche](https://www.facebook.com/DarwicheRock)
