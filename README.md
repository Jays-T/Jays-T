## ðŸ’¬ Hi there, my name is John Traas but most people call me Jays
ðŸ’¬ I have a great affinity for all things UI/UX and design related.
While the logic of back-end fascinates me and truth be told, I enjoy nearly every facet of full stack development, I do find myself leaning towards more front-end work. That said I am open to anything and am for the moment working full-stack, self-employed at:

# ![image](images/angry_cat_70x63.png) Angry Cat Design and Development
I've been lucky enough to have traveled a large portion of the world while pursuing my passion for Music and Design in Tech. 
I am a recent Full Stack Software Development graduate of Code Institute.
